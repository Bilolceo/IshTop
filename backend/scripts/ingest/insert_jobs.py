"""Insert the vetted vacancies into the site.

Every row that gets in has a contact a candidate can actually use: a phone, an
email, or an @handle that Telegram resolved to a real person or bot. Handles
that resolved to a CHANNEL are dropped here — @devs_it and @itjobsfeed are
aggregator feeds, and offering them as "the employer" is the mistake that put
130 unreachable listings on the site in the first place.

Selection favours listings that say where the work is, what it pays and what is
required, and caps how many of one role go in so the feed does not turn into
forty sales-manager posts.

--commit writes; otherwise prints the plan.
