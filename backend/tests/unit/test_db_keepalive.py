"""The API must keep the database from being slept by the platform.

Railway stops a service after roughly ten idle minutes. Setting
`sleepApplication: false` works for this API service — confirmed in its logs,
which show it alive across an idle window — but is not honoured for the
Postgres service: on 2026-09-18, with the flag false and after a full
redeploy, Postgres restarted at 13:46 and 13:57 UTC, and one of those
restarts came back running crash recovery ("database system was not properly
shut down"). A student arriving after a quiet spell got a 503.

So the API, which no longer sleeps, pings the database often enough that it
never idles. These tests pin the properties that make that safe.
