"""When a listing is visible to the public.

This rule broke twice in one day, in opposite directions:

  * `expires_at` was written on every listing and checked nowhere, so 48 active
    listings whose date had passed a week earlier were still being served;
  * the fix compared `> now()`, but the company form posts midnight UTC of the
    deadline DAY — so a job whose deadline is today became invisible the moment
    it was published, and every other one lost its final day.

Both are cheap to assert and expensive to miss, so they are asserted here
against the real SQLAlchemy expression rather than a paraphrase of it.
